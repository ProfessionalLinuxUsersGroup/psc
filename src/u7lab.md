## Lab ðŸ§ª

These labs focus on pulling metric information and then visualizing that data quickly on dashboards for real time analysis.

### Monitoring Jails with Fail2ban logs

1. Complete the lab: <https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Linux-Labs/109-fail2ban-with-logmonitoring>

   - Were you able to see the IP address that was banned and unban it?

   - Were you able to see all the NOTICE events in Grafana?

   - What other questions do you have about this lab, and how might you go figure them
     out?

### Monitoring Jails with Fail2ban and telemetry data

<img src='./assets/images/u7/image2.png'></img>

1. Complete the lab here: <https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Linux-Labs/110-fail2ban-withmetric-alerting>

   - Do you see `fail2ban` in the Grafana Dashboard? If not, how are you going to
     troubleshoot it?

   - Did you get your test alert and then real alert to trigger into the Discord channel?

   - What other applications or uses for this could you think of? Do you have other
     places you could send alerts that would help you professionally?

## Digging Deeper challenge (not required for finishing lab)

1. Review the alert manager documentation:
   <https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/>

   - What are all the types of receivers you see?

   - Which of the receivers do you have experience with?

2. Review the Grafana alert thresholds:
   <https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panelsvisualizations/configure-thresholds/>

   - Can you modify one of the thresholds from the lab to trigger into the discord?

   - What is the relationship between critical and warning by default?

> Be sure to `reboot` the lab machine from the command line when you are done.
