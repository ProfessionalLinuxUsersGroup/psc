Each course run through the Professional Linux Users Group (ProLUG) allows you to earn
a certification upon completion.

Certificates are awarded to those who complete the course within the timeframe that
it is being run through the ProLUG Discord.

- To see when courses are running, join the ProLUG Discord server and check the
  Events section.

If you aim to earn the certification for completing this course, you must follow the
guidelines set forth in this document.

There are four main components to earning the certification.

1. Worksheet Completion

2. Discussion Questions

3. Lab Completion

4. Final Project

## Worksheet Completion

---

Each unit has a corresponding worksheet.  
On this worksheet are discussion questions, terms/definitions, **optional** "digging
deeper" sections, and reflection questions.

These worksheets must be filled out and kept until the end of the course.  
Upon reaching the end, they are to be submitted to the instructor (Scott Champine).

### Worksheet Submission Format

---

The format in which you submit these worksheets is up to you.

Some students prefer to keep them in a GitHub repository, others prefer to just keep
them as files on their machines and submit via email.

## Discussion Questions

---

Each unit's worksheet contains multiple discussion questions.  
Each discussion question has its own thread in the ProLUG Discord server, in the
`#prolug-projects` channel.

To qualify for certification:

- You must post your answer to each discussion question in the correct thread.
- You must respond to another student's answer in the same thread.

The goal of this is not to create busywork, but to spark discussions and see things
from other points of view.

## Lab Completion

---

Each unit has a lab that is to be completed.

The labs, like the worksheets, should be also completed and saved until the end of
the course.

These labs should be turned in along with the worksheets in the same format of your choice.

## Final Project

---

Each ProLUG course has students complete a capstone project.

This is a requirement for earning a ProLUG course certification.

The project must meet the standards set forth in the Final Project Outline (or
otherwise be approved by the instructor, Scott Champine).
