#### Discussion Post #1

Capture all the terms and concepts that we talk about in this weekâ€™s recording.

1. How many new topics or concepts do you have to go read about now?
2. What was completely new to you?
3. What is something you heard before, but need to spend more time with?

#### Discussion Post #2

1. Think about how the course objectives apply to the things youâ€™ve worked on.
   - How would you answer if I asked you for a quick rundown of how you would
     secure a Linux system?
   - How would you answer if I asked you why you are a good fit as a security
     engineer in my company?
   - Think about what security concepts you think bear the most weight as you
     put these course objectives onto your resume.
     1. Which would you include?
     2. Which donâ€™t you feel comfortable including?
